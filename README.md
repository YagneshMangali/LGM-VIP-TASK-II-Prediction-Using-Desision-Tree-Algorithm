# Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm

This project demonstrates the application of the Decision Tree algorithm for predictive modeling. The Decision Tree is a powerful and interpretable machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. In this project, we focus on using Decision Trees for classification to predict outcomes based on input features.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations for the Decision Tree structure and performance metrics.

## Steps Covered

1. **Import Libraries**: Load essential libraries including `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and visualization tools.
2. **Load Data**: Import and inspect the dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
4. **Model Training**: Train the Decision Tree model on the training dataset.
5. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance with accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
7. **Visualization**: Visualize the Decision Tree and its performance.
